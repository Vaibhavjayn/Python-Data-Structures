    "Q1.  What are data structures, and why are they important?\n",
    "Ans. Data structures in Python are helpful in storing our data in our useful and particular structure according to given task and this also useful for easy arranging, organizing, accessing or manipulating our Data. This led us to use data accordingly and effectively. They are significant in different scenarios as there are different kinds of data structures in Python i.e if we want to make data in a proper sequential ordered way then we can use Tuple or List depending in use case, if we want to get any modification in data then it can only be possible in case of list only but not in case of tuple."

    "Ans. Mutable Data types are simply defined as the data structures which can be modified later after their creation and can be again and again changed with time whereas in immutable data types indicates those structures which can not be changed or modified later once they created. In simple meaning mutable are those which are changeable and immutable are those which are unchangeable. Like List is example of mutable and tuple is example of immutable data type."

But lists are those which fall under category of mutable data type but tuples are known to be immutable, i.e. once the tuple is created it can not be modified but list cab perform any modification. Lists can do task of adding new element but tuple can't as it can only show the data stored in it but can't add any new element in it."

    "Ans. Dictionaries are one of the data structures in python which is considered to be the best for storing the data in industry as it stores the data in KEY:VALUE pair and enclosed with {}. Like this {Key:Value} which is beneficial for storing the data which indicated unique identity or any specific identity of any object in data with KEY and VALUE will get the information of the that specific defined name. Dictionaries can also store heterogeneous type data and we can access data or any particular element from our dictionary by definig that element's specific key with dictionary name."

    "Ans. Set is considered to be useful in case when we need to get only unique elements in our data and set helps to store such data in which no duplicates are allwed only unique elements will be considered i.e if there is repeated value of any such data , it will consider only one appearance of the element and rest same elements will be neglected. Also, Sets are unordered where order of elements doesn't matter it can store data in any random order which leads to prevent any duplicate values to be put inside and majorly no indexing can be done in it so it creates chances of preserving data to get easily accessed in any specified range. Also Set performs operations like Union, Intersection, Difference and symmetric difference . Which make it versatile to perform task of joining two different sets together and ensuring duplicates to get detected. So, it can be used in doing task like above in comparison to list."

    "Ans. String is another data type which consists Characters like Name of any person, object or place, like Ram , Mohan , Delhi or Pencil and they are enclosed with \" \" sign to specify that this is string and python can easily understand what type of data we are entering. Ex. b = [\"Ram\", \"Sham\", \"Mohan\", \"Delhi\"]. Whereas in contrast with List it is way different as list is a data structure which can store each and every type of data even strings like in Ex. \"b\" and we can mix multiple data like integers, float values or even string with them in same list so, specifically we can say that list consist all data types whereas string also can consist all data types but string is immutable and list is mutable.

Tuples in Python ensure that once the elements of any data types stored in the tuple then no element will be modified i.e once the specific element is inserted the element will remain same in the tuple it will not be changed and be in same exactly like inserted during creation. We can say tuples are immutable. We can only access elements from it i.e we can do slicing to know the sequence of elements present in the tuple. We can't add any element or remove any specific element inside the tuple, this way tuple helps to make sure no data got unwantedly changed."

Also, Lists are mutable so we can anytime anywhere change the elements accordingly. \n",

    "Ans. Strings in Python is the data type which stores or consists mainly characters in it, but it also often used for indicating any other data type as string by enclosing it with \" \" , this led to mark or initiate the element as the one separate unique element and is meant to be special among all data stored with it . So to preserve the data to be used in anywhere and is meant to be specific and need to deliever special specified meanings then string will be the best choice to indicate it as required. Also, Strings will not be changeable so to ensure data meaning or usage. That's why string is meant to be immutable.\n",

    "Ans. Dictionaries are the data structure which is considered to be the best among all other data structures and it is also majorly preferable as we get the data from anywhere in dict data type i.e in {Key:Value} pair, so to label or index each record or information in the table stored in row can be put under its specific identity that is represented by its column name in Dataframe or any table. Hence to do tasks like mapping, or doing fast lookup tasks dictionary is ideal as due to its format and can easily provide specific information or record whereas list simply stores data in it and do not provide such functionalities that's why dictionary is preferable in these such tasks."

    "Ans. Using tuple in place of list would be most preferable to use in those scenario cases where we do not want to modify our stored data and it will be not be changed by anyone. Once the data is stored and tuple is created then it can be only able to show elements but no data will be changed at any stage. It helps in storing data which is highly sensitive or need to be secured from any external means, which represents belongingness a unique belonging of someone . Like in scenario where we want to store our such information like our government provided unique identity card i.e like aadhar card so we would preferably use tuple over list."

Also, Set is known as mutable data type but it stores only those values which should be immutable, i.e we can store integer, other data strucure like tuples consisting some values in it but the value should be immutable so to get each and every element inside set as unique ."

    "But in Case of Dictionaries as we are aware of dict stores value in {Key:Value} pairs so when we perform \"in\" in dictionary then it initially by default find and give results on basis of \"Key\" finding, if we want to find value then we are required to specify it to search in dict.values()."

It stores data which could be any government document or any such numbers like phone numbers which are often required to be changed.So in this case tuples are the best choice."

    "Ans. Nested Dictionary is the Dictionary inside a Dictionary i.e storing values in Dictionary form will again work as values in the outer dictionary and will be assigned with their each unique key. This is done to enhance more uniqueness of records of our data so to obtain it with more ease and can be done to know the components of any specific data. Example in real world can be seen in making of employee records of any company where the name,department,salary can be such factors that are used to define unique employee in the data but when there is different employees but having same name,department and salary then in that case we are required to identify our employee with more uniqueness by specifying unique employee_id to each employee that helps to discard any possibility of confusion."

    "Ans. Dictionaries in Python are implemented as Hash Tables. Which means the way where Hashing is used for fast data access.\n",
    "Instead of searching through every item (like in a list), Python uses the hash value to jump straight to the location in memory where the data is stored.This gives us that amazing O(1) time complexity for lookups as Hashing is the process of converting data into a fixed-size number (called a hash value or hash code) using a mathematical function called a hash function.This gives us the unique address or unique location to find our stored value in Dictionary.This helps to directly access the value by its indicated key hash number or value. The time complexity is almost always Average case i.e O(1) which means constant time regardless of the size of the dictionary."

But still there is such situatuions where using list is beneficial according to use case, like we want to store data in a order in a proper sequence that can be done in both but list offers indexing to access elements by their position(also called as index) and also for the type of data where we want to store duplicate elements where list can store duplicates easily but in dictionary we need to specify that the key can't be duplicate but yes the values stored under unique key can be duplicate. Also Lists require less memory to store in compare to dictionaries."

In older version, Dictionaries are used to be unordered as it do not preserve insertion order due to which when we input data in form of dictionary and print it in output the order is totally changed so at the time of data retrieval we are required to access the value by specifying its key whereas now in latest versions, dictionaries do preserve insertion order but still can not be accessed the elements according to the insertion order or by index like lists do , they still use to specify key for the value to be accessed.

    "Ans. In lists, when we want to retrieve any element then we are having facility to access element by specifying its position or index where it is suited and also lists follow insertion order, and also do the linear search through whole list to search the specific required item from start to end that need to be accessed when we are using \"in\" keyword . Whereas, in Dictionary, Data is simply accessed by indicating its KEY, the unique identity of that specific value stored in Dictionary, this helps to directly get the element stored in memory rather than searching linearly , work same in case of \"in\" keyword."
